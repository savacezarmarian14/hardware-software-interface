# Keeping Records

Navigate to `drills/tasks/regs-preserve/support` and open `main.asm`

In this subdirectory of the lab's task repository you will find the `print_reverse_array()` function implemented by a simple loop that makes repeated calls of the `printf()` function.

Follow the code in the `main.asm` file, compile and run the program. What happened?
The program runs indefinitely. This is because the `printf()` function does not preserve the value in the `ecx` register, used here as a counter.

Uncomment the lines marked `TODO1` and rerun the program.

# Troubleshooting SEGFAULT

Decompose the lines marked `TODO2` in the assembly file from the previous exercise.
The code sequence makes a call to the `double_array()` function, implemented in C, just before displaying the vector using the function seen earlier.

Compile and run the program. To debug the segfault you can use the `objdump` utility to trace the assembly language code corresponding to the `double_array()` function.
Notice which of the registers used before and after the call are modified by this function.

Add the instructions for preserving and restoring the required registers to the assembly file.
